# Agent & Agentic Developer Tooling

A slide deck created for a presentation about building agent workflows, sharing personal experiences and lessons learned.

## üìñ About This Deck

This presentation was built in the spirit of "good enough" - it's not perfect code, but it works and tells the story effectively. The slides reflect my personal journey building agent tooling and the patterns that worked (and didn't work) in practice.

**What this is**: A presentation deck with code snippets and personal experiences  
**What this isn't**: Working code or a tutorial

## üöÄ Quick Start (Good Enough‚Ñ¢)

```bash
# Clone and go
git clone https://github.com/ldadams/rva-agentic-development
cd rva-agentic-development
npm install && npm run build && npm run start
# ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
```

**Live version**: https://rva-slides.netlify.app/

## üì± Navigation (Keep It Simple)

- **Desktop**: Arrow keys, click buttons
- **Mobile**: Swipe left/right  
- **Print**: Press 'P' (surprisingly useful)
- **Links**: Every slide has "deck" and "github" links at bottom

## üìä What's Inside (11 Slides, ~15 min)

1. **Setup** - Why agents > autocomplete
2. **Context** - Org-specific pain points  
3. **Lessons** - Start small, add guards
4. **Intent Classification** - Simple routing patterns
5. **State Graph vs ReAct** - When to use which
6. **MCP Integration** - Real enterprise patterns
7. **RAG Path** - Knowledge lookup workflows
8. **Workflow Path** - Org-specific automations
9. **Guardrails** - Simple guards new engineers can use
10. **Takeaways** - Realistic expectations & vibe coding
11. **Q&A** - Let's talk about your agent chaos

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (classic stack)  
**Theme**: VS Code dark (because we live there anyway)  
**Philosophy**: Ship fast, iterate, good enough is often perfect

## üìù Personal Experience Notes

These are patterns and approaches from my experience building agent tooling. The code snippets are simplified for presentation purposes - they illustrate concepts but aren't meant to be copy-pasted into production.

The deck itself was built quickly using the same "good enough" approach discussed in the slides - it does what it needs to do without over-engineering.

## ü§ù Usage

Feel free to use or adapt these slides. The code snippets are for illustration - actual implementation details will vary based on your specific needs.
