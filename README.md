# Agent & Agentic Developer Tooling

*"If you aren't vibe coding, start now" - and sometimes 'good enough' is exactly that.*

A pragmatic slide deck about building agent workflows that actually work. Built with the same philosophy we preach: start small, iterate fast, ship when it's good enough.

## üéØ The Vibe

This presentation exists because:
- **Off-the-shelf copilots can't solve org-specific pain points** 
- **We need workflow agents embedded in our actual processes**
- **Junior vs Senior: knowing what 'great' and 'good enough' looks like matters**
- **Sometimes the best code is the code that ships and solves real problems**

## üöÄ Quick Start (Good Enough‚Ñ¢)

```bash
# Clone and go
git clone https://github.com/ldadams/rva-agentic-development
cd rva-agentic-development
npm install && npm run build && npm run start
# ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
```

**Live version**: https://rva-slides.netlify.app/

## üì± Navigation (Keep It Simple)

- **Desktop**: Arrow keys, click buttons
- **Mobile**: Swipe left/right  
- **Print**: Press 'P' (surprisingly useful)
- **Links**: Every slide has "deck" and "github" links at bottom

## üìä What's Inside (11 Slides, ~15 min)

1. **Setup** - Why agents > autocomplete
2. **Context** - Org-specific pain points  
3. **Lessons** - Start small, add guards
4. **Intent Classification** - Simple routing patterns
5. **State Graph vs ReAct** - When to use which
6. **MCP Integration** - Real enterprise patterns
7. **RAG Path** - Knowledge lookup workflows
8. **Workflow Path** - Org-specific automations
9. **Guardrails** - Simple guards new engineers can use
10. **Takeaways** - Realistic expectations & vibe coding
11. **Q&A** - Let's talk about your agent chaos

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (classic stack)  
**Theme**: VS Code dark (because we live there anyway)  
**Philosophy**: Ship fast, iterate, good enough is often perfect

## üéì The Real Lessons

### **Start Pragmatic**
- 1 workflow, 3-5 nodes, typed state
- Add guards when things break (they will)
- Log everything, debug with LLMs

### **Set Expectations** 
- Junior devs: agents aren't magic, they're tools
- Senior devs: know when to stop polishing agent output
- Everyone: humans own the merge button

### **Vibe Coding Philosophy**
- Build agents that solve your actual daily pain
- Use whatever LLM you have access to (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Start small, ship when it works, iterate based on real usage

## ü§ù Contributing

This deck practices what it preaches:
- **Good enough code**: It works, it's readable, it ships
- **Real patterns**: Every code example comes from actual agent building
- **Honest about limitations**: We call out the rough edges

PRs welcome, especially if they make the examples more realistic or fix actual presentation bugs you encounter.
