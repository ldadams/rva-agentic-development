# Agent & Agentic Developer Tooling

A slide deck created for a presentation about building agent workflows, sharing personal experiences and lessons learned.

## üìñ About This Deck

This presentation was built in the spirit of "good enough" - it's not perfect code, but it works and tells the story effectively. The slides reflect my personal journey building agent tooling and the patterns that worked (and didn't work) in practice.

**What this is**: A collection of real experiences, working code examples, and honest takes on agent development  
**What this isn't**: A definitive guide or the only way to build agents

## üöÄ Quick Start (Good Enough‚Ñ¢)

```bash
# Clone and go
git clone https://github.com/ldadams/rva-agentic-development
cd rva-agentic-development
npm install && npm run build && npm run start
# ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
```

**Live version**: https://rva-slides.netlify.app/

## üì± Navigation (Keep It Simple)

- **Desktop**: Arrow keys, click buttons
- **Mobile**: Swipe left/right  
- **Print**: Press 'P' (surprisingly useful)
- **Links**: Every slide has "deck" and "github" links at bottom

## üìä What's Inside (11 Slides, ~15 min)

1. **Setup** - Why agents > autocomplete
2. **Context** - Org-specific pain points  
3. **Lessons** - Start small, add guards
4. **Intent Classification** - Simple routing patterns
5. **State Graph vs ReAct** - When to use which
6. **MCP Integration** - Real enterprise patterns
7. **RAG Path** - Knowledge lookup workflows
8. **Workflow Path** - Org-specific automations
9. **Guardrails** - Simple guards new engineers can use
10. **Takeaways** - Realistic expectations & vibe coding
11. **Q&A** - Let's talk about your agent chaos

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (classic stack)  
**Theme**: VS Code dark (because we live there anyway)  
**Philosophy**: Ship fast, iterate, good enough is often perfect

## üìù Personal Experience Notes

These are patterns and approaches that worked in my experience building agent tooling. Your mileage may vary, and that's perfectly fine. The code examples are simplified for presentation but based on real implementations.

The deck itself was built quickly using the same "good enough" approach discussed in the slides - it does what it needs to do without over-engineering.

## ü§ù Usage

Feel free to use, adapt, or learn from any of these slides and code examples. The goal is sharing what worked, not prescribing the only way to do things.
